Analysis on Bank Loan Defaults - A deep dive into the factors affecting credit default

This is an exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset of a commercial bank. The problem statement is that the bank wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The insights derived from the analysis may enable the bank to make optimal decisions on the loan applications, decisions that are more aligned with revenue maximisation.
